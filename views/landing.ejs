    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p>When some people think of camping, they tend to imagine forest fires and getting 
        gored by bears. However, this is not the case; it is highly unlikely any of these 
        two actually ever happen. In most cases people who have been on a camping trip once 
        always want to do it again. There is so much to do out there in the wild.
        One of the reasons you should go on a camping trip is the stars. For a person
        like me who lives in the city, I always enjoy a trip out into the untamed hinterland. 
        It is always an opportunity to gaze upon the stars in the night sky. 
        A camping trip presents you with an opportunity to reconnect with loved ones. 
        This is one of the reasons it is so much fun. It is the experience of a lifetime.
        There are few activities that are more fun in this world than sitting by a campfire. 
        It presents one with the opportunity to reflect upon their life in a way only possible
        by a camp fire.
